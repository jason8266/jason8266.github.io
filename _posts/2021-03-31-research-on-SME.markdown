At present, the international economic environment is volatile, the downward pressure on the domestic economy is increasing, and the survival pressure of enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, is increasing. It is urgent to rely on innovation to improve the added value and competitiveness of products. Under the above background, the Innov-SMEr research team went to the "China's first manufacturing county" - Jiangyin manufacturing SMEs twice in April and July 2018, in order to explore the solution of the three major innovation bottlenecks through targeted services The "market failure" problem and the remedy for the problem of government innovation policy failure.
In order to deeply study the innovation status of manufacturing SMEs in Jiangyin, we refer to the enterprise innovation questionnaires of the European Union, the United States and the National Bureau of Statistics, combined with the innovation reality of manufacturing enterprises in Jiangyin, to design enterprise innovation questionnaires, which are issued to enterprises above designated size in Jiangyin manufacturing. With the strong support of the Jiangyin Municipal Government, 1,343 questionnaires were distributed and returned, accounting for about 10% of the manufacturing enterprises above designated size in Jiangyin City, with only 10 large enterprises and 99.27% ​​of small and medium-sized enterprises. The questionnaire contains 14 major items, 74 questions, and a total of 368 options, covering the production and operation of manufacturing SMEs, various innovation activities (products, processes, sales, management, etc.), innovation project financing, innovation information acquisition, innovation Cooperation, measures to encourage innovation within enterprises, factors affecting innovation, government fiscal and taxation support, innovation environment and benefits, and future development plans.
The research team surveyed more than 50 representative companies in the form of visits and discussions. The interview notes were 85,000 words and the recording time was 1,500 minutes. Finally, a research report of nearly 50,000 words was formed.
The work has the following characteristics:
## Representative of Jiangyin samples
The research object is Jiangyin's manufacturing SMEs, originating from "China's first manufacturing county". The sample is very representative and universal, which means that our research results can be promoted and used for reference.
## Research logic and research thread
The work starts with the research on the causes of the extremely low innovation success rate of single manufacturing SMEs, and summarizes and refines the causes of their innovation difficulties as "market failure" and "government failure"; but in Jiangyin, the same manufacturing SMEs can pass The "collaborative innovation" (Jiangyin experience) of "strong cooperation" has significantly improved the success rate of innovation, and effectively solved the problems of "market failure" and "government failure" existing in the innovation of small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises; "Accurately summarizes and refines the collaborative innovation paradigm that can be universally applied and promoted across the country; on this basis, the work further studies the role the government should play in supporting enterprise innovation, and proposes a "targeted service" concept to promote functional and service innovation. Relevant policy recommendations to further expand the capacity for collaborative innovation of enterprises.
## Condensing Jiangyin's Experience to Create a Paradigm of Collaborative Innovation for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
Taking the successful innovation experience of SMEs in Jiangyin manufacturing industry as a sample, six representative collaborative innovation combinations are summarized, namely: upstream and downstream synergy of the industrial chain, inter-industry (inter-industry) cross-border synergy, project contract synergy, and equity joint venture synergy , large and medium-sized enterprises, and enterprises and schools. The work further extracts the same-sex characteristics of these six collaborative innovation combinations, and demonstrates a paradigm that can effectively improve the innovation success rate of manufacturing SMEs by creating a multi-party game model (following the "enterprise-based, market-oriented" principle and "comparison". This research result is a new contribution to the theoretical research of my country's supply-side sharing economy.
## The collaborative innovation paradigm of manufacturing SMEs has passed the verification of 1343 samples
Based on the data of 1343 enterprise innovation questionnaires in Jiangyin, a multiple regression model with interactive items was established, and an empirical analysis was carried out on the collaborative innovation paradigm. It can effectively solve the problems of "market failure" and "government failure" in SME innovation.
## Further cracking down on "government failure" with "targeted services"
Based on the information of entrepreneur symposiums, enterprise interviews, and enterprise innovation questionnaires, the "pain points" of innovation of SMEs in the manufacturing industry at this stage are condensed, the concept of "targeted therapy" in medicine is introduced, and "pain points" are regarded as "targeting" , believes that local governments should further solve the "government failure" through the innovation of the function and service of "targeted service" (six policy recommendations), so as to expand the collaborative innovation of manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises, and promote the high-quality development of the innovative economy.
The difficulty of innovation in my country's manufacturing SMEs has always been an unsolved problem. As the former Minister of Science and Technology Wan Gang said, it is a "hard bone". Our work, based on the summary and refinement of Jiangyin's experience, provides high-quality research results for successfully solving this problem in practice, theory and policy. Compared with the existing research results (see the attached literature review), our work is more groundbreaking and has higher case value, theoretical value and policy value.
This work was released by the Innov-SMEr student team at the "Jiangsu SME Research Achievement Conference" on December 6, 2018. The results have also been highly valued by Jiangyin Municipal Government and Jiangyin Municipal Science and Technology Bureau. Some suggestions have been adopted and included in a series of policy measures to support enterprise innovation formulated by Jiangyin Municipal Government and relevant departments, and have received good feedback (see Jiangyin Municipal Government Provided evaluation materials). At the same time, this work has been submitted to the inspection team of the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the National Development and Reform Commission to Jiangsu to conduct research on small and medium-sized enterprises in November 2018 and February 2019 according to different requirements, and has been fully affirmed and highly praised. Some of these policy recommendations have been reflected in the guiding opinions on "Enhancing the Innovation and Development Capability of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises" in the fifth part of the "Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Healthy Development of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises" issued by the Central Office.
