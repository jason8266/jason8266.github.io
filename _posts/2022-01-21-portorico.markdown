# Day 1

We bought United Airlines to get to the Porto Rico. During the whole flight process, it was fun because the Wifi in United Airlines could get access to Wechat app, which is quite common for a Chinese user.

# Day 2
We had fun in the main island, seeking for wonderful food, and had a great view of the ocean. The fact is that the ocean in Porto Rico looks a little bit green, which gave us a great feeling.

# Day 3
We bought the small airplane ticket to fly to another island(vieques) in Porto Rico. The flight only took about 5 minutes, so the plane is not that large. But it is pretty cool to get this experience.

# Day 4
Still in vieques island, we took a trip to the black sand beach. The sand there really showed a dark colour. It is worth mentioning that the sand there is also magnetic, which is said to be good for the skin.

# Day 5
We joined a yacht! It is not difficult to master the skills of snorkeling for the first time in my life. We listened to music and drank on the yacht and saw a lot of coral reefs and fish on the bottom of the sea! Because it is not convenient to take pictures underwater, I can only keep the paper photos taken by the underwater camera.

# Day 6
We are close to nature on this day. We signed up for a tour and went on a jungle adventure to the only tropical rainforest in the United States. There we jumped, rock climbed and got covered in mud, but it was a rare experience.

# Day 7
We visited the castle, which is said to have been created by the Spanish army to prevent the invasion of foreign enemies. But now the castle seems to have become the home of the lizards. But it is undeniable that although the army of the year is gone, the castle built by the sea can still allow tourists to enjoy the beautiful waves.
